    <p>Country music is quite unique from the other genres of music. The accents of the singers are unique when compared to other genres of music. The tempo of the music is typically slower than most genres of music. You will often hear in many country songs are the writer's personal stories or accounts of love, loss, and experience that are supposed to connect with the listener. <br /> My favorite artist in the country music genre is Billy Curington. He is very good at writing music about his love stories and experiences that I often can connect to. He also has a very soulful voice that allows the listener to feel comforted and relaxed while listening to his music. My favorite song of his is Good Directions because when I listen to the song it paints a very clear picture in my head from the lyrics.'***'</p>
